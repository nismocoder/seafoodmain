                            <p>Bairdi crabs have short tails and are very specialized. They have five pairs of legs, the
                                first<br>
                                one containing pincers, and a body that is made mostly of a shell or a carapace that has
                                a small<br>
                                abdominal flap.<br><br>

                                They are also called Tanner crabs and are a variety of the Snow crab. They are decapods
                                that can get<br>
                                up to four pounds in weight, and their diet consists mostly of clams, worms, and other
                                crustaceans <br>
                                found on the ocean bottom.<br><br>

                                Bairdi crabs are also called “true” crabs, and their pincer claws are in the front of
                                their legs. In <br>
                                recent years, Bairdi crabs have suffered due to overfishing, which has resulted in
                                strict controls <br>
                                being placed over fisheries that specialize in this type of crab.<br><br>

                                Of all of the Snow crab varieties, this type of crab is by far the largest, and it can
                                be steamed, <br>
                                boiled, grilled, sautéed, or even roasted.

                        <p>The Latin name for blue crabs means “beautiful swimmer,” and the name suits it well because

                            beautiful, blue-green-colored crab. Found quite frequently on the Eastern coast of the

                            blue crabs can be from 3.5 to 5.5 inches in sizes, sometimes larger.<br><br>

                            Even though they are a beautiful blue color, they do change to a reddish color as other
                            crabs when they<br>
                            are cooked. They have meat that is tender and sweet, and they are some of the most heavily
                            harvested <br>
                            animals on the planet. They are bottom-dwelling omnivores whose males can reach up to nine

                            world, getting up to nine pounds in weight and up to sixteen inches long.<br><br>

                            Moreover, each long leg of the Coconut crab can be as wide as three feet in span, although
                            their maximum<br>
                            size isn’t reached until they are roughly forty to sixty years old. The reason they are

                            Coconut crabs are that they love coconuts and will even climb trees to get at them. It is
                            also a variety<br>
                            of the Hermit crab, although it doesn’t have a shell when it is fully grown as those crabs
                            do.<br><br>

                            Coconut crabs eat meats, nuts, fruits, and seeds, and one aspect that makes them unique is
                            their inability<br>
                            to survive for long periods of time under the water – in fact, they will eventually drown if

                            underwater for too long.<br><br>

                            Found frequently in territories around the Pacific and Indian oceans, Coconut crabs only
                            have two distinct<br>

                        <p>Dungeness crabs are very large, usually weighing from 1.75 to 4 pounds, and they have a color
                            that is <br>
                            purplish-brown. They are found in the waters from Alaska to the Baja area of Mexico and are
                            named for a town<br>
                            called Dungeness, which was formerly found in Washington State.<br><br>

                            In order to be harvested, they are required by law to be a minimum of 6.25 inches in length,
                            and only the <br>
                            males are allowed to be harvested. They have a sweet, succulent flesh that is pink in color,
                            and their prime<br>
                            season is Winter time.<br><br>

                            Dungeness crabs have very hard shells and five separate pairs of legs. They are captured
                            mostly through hooks<br>
                            and lines, baited pots, nets, and even by hand. Most Dungeness crabs live approximately ten
                            years, and because <br>
                            of their taste, there is an extremely popular type of crab to eat.

                        <div class="crabPic5"></div>
                        <p>Hermit crabs are usually purchased as pets for children because they are fun to play with and
                            very small. There are<br>
                            roughly 1,100 species of Hermit crabs, divided into seven different families.<br><br>

                            They use gastropod shells that hide their soft abdomen as they grow larger because without
                            these shells they are <br>
                            open to a predator’s attack. Not only do the shells protect the abdomen, but the crabs can
                            also hide within them whenever<br>
                            necessary.<br><br>

                            In fact, Hermit crabs consider their shells so important that they are known to kill other
                            Hermit crabs in order to steal<br>
                            their shell. With Hermit crabs, lifespans and sizes vary greatly and in fact, they can live
                            anywhere from a few months <br>
                            all the way up to thirty years.<br><br>

                            If they live in the wild, Hermit crabs are very social and live in colonies that are quite
                            large, which might be because <br>
                            they are always on the lookout to steal another crab’s shell.

                        <div class="crabPic6"></div>
                        <p>Because this crab looks like a horseshoe, this is how the item gets its name. One of the most
                            interesting aspects of<br>
                            horseshoe crabs is that they have been around some 500-million years, and they are found
                            along the Atlantic coast <br>
                            from Nova Scotia to the Yucatan, as well as Asian coasts, the Philippines, and
                            India.<br><br>

                            Although their shell-to-meat ratio is relatively small, they are still edible and very
                            tasty. They are very commonly<br>
                            found on Florida beaches, and they have a spike-like tail that many people consider
                            dangerous, even though it is <br>
                            completely harmless.<br><br>

                            Of course, this is not to say you should pick up a horseshoe crab by the tail, because that
                            action can harm the <br>
                            animal. Horseshoe crabs have ten eyes and in fact, are not really crabs at all, being more
                            closely related to animals<br>
                            such as scorpions, ticks, and even spiders.

                            They can also be called rock or bay crabs, although the rock crabs are usually actually a
                            type called a snow crab.<br><br>

                            Peekytoe crabs have white meat with little specks of pink and a very sweet flavor that is
                            enjoyed by all types of <br>
                            chefs. In fact, this type of crab is very popular among chefs nowadays, because that’s how
                            good the meat is, in part<br>
                            because you can use this crab in everything from salads to crab rolls and much more.

                        <div class="crabPic9"></div>
                        <p>Found along the Eastern coast of the United States as well as other bodies of water, rock
                            crabs have legs that make it<br>
                            look like a spider, which is the reason they can also be called spider crabs.<br><br>

                            Other names include Queen crabs and tanner crabs. Snow crabs found in the Bering Sea can be
                            found approximately 650 feet<br>
                            below the surface, in sandy or muddy environments.<br><br>

                            Over their lifetime, Snow crabs usually migrate from shallow to deep waters. They also have
                            a unique form of protecting <br>
                            themselves, as they usually use one of their legs – which contains a small circular groove
                            at the base – to snap off a <br>
                            leg should it be held by a predator or get entangled to the point where it cannot escape any
                            other way.<br><br>

                            This is not a problem for them, because they can grow another leg from the scar where the
                            last one was found.

                        <div class="crabPic10"></div>
                        <p>Stone crabs have large claws that are very hard and have a lot of meat on the inside. With
                            stone crabs, only the claws<br>
                            themselves are eaten, and since crabs can regenerate their claws every eighteen months,
                            fishermen often twist off a <br>
                            claw and toss the crabs back into the water, leaving them with one claw to defend
                            themselves.<br><br>

                            By law, stone crabs have to be boiled for seven minutes, after which they must be frozen or
                            put on ice. This is because,<br>
                            without freezing, stone crabs can have an iodine taste that is not very pleasant.<br><br>

                            If chefs wish to learn which claws have the most meat, they float them in a tank of water.
                            The crabs with less meat will<br>
                            float to the top of the tank, and they then sell those crabs as “lights.”<br><br>

                            With a firm texture and a taste that is sweet and succulent, stone crabs have to be 2 to
                            2.75 ounces in size. They are <br>
                            usually cracked open with a mallet and served with a variety of dipping sauces.
