                            <p>Sockeye salmon, or red salmon, is known for its striking red-orange flesh and strong
                                scent.<br>
                                It's said to have a richer flavor, or what some might describe as "fishier."<br><br>

                                They're smaller and leaner than Kings, and a lot cheaper too. Sockeye salmon is
                                often
                                sold

                                and are a favorite among chefs across the country. Not only do they get their name
                                for
                                bright red flesh,<br>
                                but their skin also turns a deep red as they swim upstream to spawn. They're mostly
                                caught
                                in Alaskan waters.

                            <p>Coho or silver salmon get their name for their bright silver skin. Although they

                                that massive Kings and flavorful Sockeyes do, Coho has a medium fat-content and a
                                more
                                subtle flavor.<br><br>

                                Because of their small size, Cohos are often used when cooking a whole salmon. Their
                                flavor
                                is similar to Kings, <br>
                                but Cohos are more delicate in texture. They're commonly found in Alaskan waters and
                                much of
                                the northern Pacific.

                            <p>This salmon goes by pink, humpback, or even "humpies" because they have a distinctive
                                hump on

                                Although they can be found fresh and frozen, they're typically processed and sold in

                                pouches. Most pink salmon is <br>
                                harvested from Alaskan fisheries, but they can also be found on the coasts of
                                Washington
                                and

                                harvested more pink salmon than all other fish in 2017, all 495 million pounds of

                                However, it does have one big thing going for it: its roe. Roe, or fish eggs

                                salmon. It's often used for Ikura (salmon caviar).<br>

                                all commercially available Atlantic salmon is farmed. This is because only small,

                            <p>Also known as Northern bluefin tuna, longtail tuna is a slimmer species. It also has
                                shorter <br>
                                fins than other tuna and so is quite distinguishable.<br><br>

                                Longtail tuna can be found in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It is medium
                                in

                                Unfortunately, longtail tuna are at risk of being overfished. This is because they
                                grow
                                slower<br>
                                and live longer, and so don’t have the reproductive turnover that other types of

                            <p>While some tuna are enormous, others, like the blackfin tuna, is much smaller. In

                                Blackfin tuna live in the Atlantic Ocean, but can be found as far north as New York
                                and

                                as Brazil.<br><br>

                                It can take a bit of effort to properly catch a blackfin tuna. While you can use

                                However, once reeled in, blackfin tuna make a delicious meal and a whole fish can

                            <p>The king of tuna, Pacific bluefin tuna is a massive fish. In fact, it can grow up to
                                10
                                feet <br>

                                While there are many types of tuna, as we will see in this article, when most people
                                think of <br>
                                tuna, this is the species that comes to mind.<br><br>

                                There are many interesting tidbits about Pacific bluefin tuna. They are a pelagic
                                fish,
                                which <br>
                                means that instead of swimming near the bottom of the ocean floor or by the shore,
                                they
                                instead <br>
                                swim in the open water.<br><br>

                                Pacific bluefin tuna are prized for their delicious taste and are a staple with
                                sashimi.
                                In fact,<br>
                                the market is so high for them in Japan that they are often bid on at exorbitant

                            <p>Fish are funny creatures and the skipjack tuna is no exception. It has its name
                                because
                                it likes to<br>
                                skip and jump while swimming through the ocean.<br><br>

                                Other characteristics of skipjack tuna include dark lines on their bellies. They are

                                and grow to be 3 feet in length and about 60 pounds in weight.<br><br>

                                You can find skipjack tuna in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. While you

                                In combination with bigeye tuna, they are known as ahi. If you order a poke bowl or

                                The overfishing of Southern bluefin tuna is linked to technological advances in the

                                imagery and GPS. The result is that there are now strict restrictions on how many
