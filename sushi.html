                            <p>Fish or shellfish served alone (no rice). <br>
                                This is best for people who really love to taste the fish or shellfish since it

                                These rolls often have lots of toppings and sauces — they may either be cooked or raw.

                                The cones are not as easy to share as the rolls (though very delicious!)

                            <p> Temari sushi is made with a mix of colorful toppings and sushi rice that are <br>
                                formed into ball shapes.

                                Instead of the typically formed sushi, you get a colorful mix of ingredients<br>
                                scattered over the sushi rice that is served in a Hangiri or a large serving platter.

                                This rich and delicately full-flavored hearty fish is a heavy hitter, but not in fat

                            <h1>Aji - Spanish Mackerel</h1>
                            <div class="ajiSashimi"></div>
                            <p>Saba’s flavor is incredibly complex so many will simply describe it as “flavorful” or<br>
                                “strong.” It has a bit of fishiness (not too much when fresh), saltiness, some notes<br>
                                of sourness from both the natural flavor of the fish and vinegar marinade, and deep<br>
                                umami. When at its freshest and fattiest, it can even be quite sweet.</p>

                            <h1>Amaebi - Sweet Shrimp</h1>
                            <div class="amaebiSashimi"></div>
                            <p>Translating to “sweet shrimp,” ama-ebi has a bit of a slimy texture and is commonly<br>
                                served raw and butterflied as sashimi (as well as sushi); it’s somewhat common to<br>
                                see it listed on the menus of fairly upscale Japanese restaurants. Its taste is<br>
                                very sweet, and chef Saito singles out ama-ebi from Hokkaido in Japan as his <br>
                                go-to, while chef Kousaka prefers using the delicacy found in Maine, calling it<br>
                                “super fresh and so clear that it’s almost transparent.” He does admit, however,<br>
                                that the availability of the state’s ama-ebi has decreased in the past half-<br>
                                decade and that it’s become more rare these days.</p>

                            <h1>Anago - Saltwater Eel</h1>

                            <p>Sushi beginners often mistake anago with unagi, which is its freshwater counterpart.<br>
                                Although they both belong to the eel family, there’s a lot of difference between the<br>
                                two. Just like unagi, anago is also never consumed raw in sushi.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Aoyagi - Round Clam</h1>

                                aroma, and the flesh is soft and chewy. It is soft in flavors, and the sweet aromas
                                become<br>
                                more evident after it is chewed for a while.</p>

                            <h1>Bincho - Albacore White Tuna</h1>
                            <div class="binchoSashimi"></div>
                            <p>Albacore is a type of tuna in the scombridae family. It is also commonly known as a
                                albacore<br>
                                fish or simply a tune. Albacore is very precious because it could be made into a sashimi
                                or a<br>
                                sushi. It is one of the most common type of tuna being made into a sashimi or sushi.

                                sashimi is very delicious and there are various ways in order to create a perfect

                                sashimi. Albacore is already a perfect fish and mixing it with different ingredients
                                would<br>
                                even make it perfect. Albacore sashimi is a common and popular type of sashimi and it is

                                delicious and healthy to eat. But it should be a sashimi grade albacore and not just any
                                <br>
                                ordinary albacore tuna.</p>

                            <h1>Katsuo - Skipjack Tuna</h1>
                            <div class="katsuoSashimi"></div>
                            <p>Skipjack tuna, which accounts for nearly half of global tuna production, is known for<br>
                                its strong flavor and attractive pink, fatty and chunky flesh. Skipjack is the most<br>
                                abundant commercial tuna species, common in tropical and warm, temperate waters of <br>
                                Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans where it inhabits surface waters in large shoals.

                            <h1>Ebi - Tiger Shrimp</h1>
                            <div class="ebiSashimi"></div>
                            <p>Shrimp Shrimp is usually poached before it is prepared although it is better steamed,<br>
                                since it locks the flavors inside. It is a very basic sushi that doesn't get the <br>
                                reputation that it deserves. Originally it was made with the now pricey kuroma <br>
                                shrimp (wheel shrimp). The kuruma shrimp is juicer, and has a sweeter aroma and <br>
                                competes well with a lobster. Poor preparation due to negligence and the recent <br>
                                use of smaller shrimp (such as bay shrimp) has made the shrimp sushi become rather<br>
                                ordinary. The Black Tiger shrimp is the best alternative to the kuruma shrimp <br>
                                since they are in the same genus. It is a delicacy for shrimp to be prepared raw<br>
                                in sushi. Though some connoisseurs may go after it for the fresh taste, shrimp is<br>
                                considered to be the tastiest when lightly heated and medium rare, since the <br>
                                sweet flavor is magnified. If it is poached too long, the flesh becomes too <br>
                                hard, and the flavors are bled out into the boiling water and you are left with<br>
                                a rubbery piece of shrimp. When consumed raw (which has to be extra fresh),<br>
                                shrimp has a slight metallic aftertaste that lingers on your palate and can<br>
                                mask the tastes of the following sushi that you may eat.</p>

                            <p>Yellowtail Hamachi is a very popular white fish that is often confused with tuna

                                shell is used for the main sushi ingredient. Other parts of the body are not used.
                                Scallops have<br>
                                big cylindrical connector (or adductor) muscles since they can jump and swim near the
                                ocean floor.<br>
                                The scallop is prepared by immersing them in saltwater with the same concentration of

                                This way, they expel sand that is trapped in their system. After they are shelled the

                                flattened out and made into a nigiri. If the scallop is barely grilled, the sweetness

                                however, the fresh texture is lost. To intensify the sweetness of the scallop, it is
                                best to<br>
                                use wasabi, but sea salt, and a drop of citrus also works well instead of soy sauce.</p>

                                and the sushi rice doesn't settle with it easily. Vertical slits are made on the squid

                                as well. A normal squid sushi uses the mantle or the hood of the squid. Some people

                                Since the salmon roe are immersed in soy sauce, not much more is required. However, if

                                extra work is needed for them to be freshly available to customers. Although small in

                                require very large aquariums to be kept alive, so fish markets usually do this job of

                                Sardine sushi is a delicacy made with a low grade fish, but is considered one of the

                            <p>Japanese Red Snapper There are many types of fish referred to as snapper. In Japan the
                                preferred option is<br>
                                generally Pagrus major. This fish is in high demand and is known by a number of English

                                commonly red sea bream and Japanese sea perch. The technical Japanese term for this fish

                            <p>Octopus Octopus is always poached for sushi, and the leg is the section used. It is eaten
                                raw as a sashimi<br>

                                cooked is because it is too bland when it is raw. It has sweet aromas, but it is very
                                hard to taste. <br>
                                The octopus is first washed with salt by exfoliating the slippery texture that it has on
                                its skin. <br>
                                Then it is massaged for a while and thumped with a peeled daikon radish.The radish's

                                result in a chunk of rubber. After poaching, the octopus's sweet aromas are enhanced,
                                though still <br>
                                very faint. Like the squid, it is hard to make into a nigiri because the slice is flat
                                and stiff. A<br>

                                texture of the tentacles, so they are sometimes all removed, one by one, and served as a

                                is the most basic Edo style sushi. It is one of the oldest ingredients used, and often
                                regarded as the icon<br>
                                of sushi. The tuna has a simple, but robust taste. It has almost no fat, and has a firm
                                flesh. The blue fin<br>
                                tuna or honmaguro (true tuna), nicknamed the "black diamond" (for its shiny cobalt
                                skin), is considered the<br>
                                best match for Edo style sushi, and is appreciated much more than the yellow fin or ahi
                                tuna. The yellow <br>
                                fin lives in the warm currents and its flesh is bland, due to high water content, and
                                soft compared to the<br>
                                blue fin which lives in the cold currents. The yellow fin tuna has little or no fatty
                                section as well. This<br>
                                is a characteristic of fish that dwell in warm waters. The blue fin tuna has a firm
                                flesh, the best tuna <br>
                                belly section, and has a deeper red color compared to the bright ruby tone of the yellow
                                tail. Tuna is best<br>
                                to eat it in its most simplest form. Wasabi, and soy sauce is the best match. No special

                                required. It is usually ordered after the lighter white fishes, and before the richer

                                as Spanish mackerel, tuna belly, sea urchin, and salmon roe. The old zuke method, where
                                the sliced sashimi<br>
                                is soaked in soy sauce for a short period of time, is a popular choice. This was done in

                        <p>You must know what to eat with sushi. I usually start my meal with miso soup and possibly
                            some tempura—fried vegetables<br>
                            in a crunchy batter.<br><br>

                            With your sushi, you will probably get wasabi (green paste made from Japanese horseradish)
                            and ginger (pink pickled slices).<br><br>

                            The Japanese use ginger to clear their palettes between courses. The wasabi should be mixed
                            with shoyu (soy sauce) as a <br>
                            dipping sauce for your sushi.<br><br>

                            The sushi roll you get might have brightly colored orange spheres or tiny black spheres on
                            it—these are both roe, which <br>
                            are fish eggs.<br><br>

                            -Tobiko is the roe of flying fish and is usually a bright orange, though it can be colored
                            to be black or even green.<br><br>
                            -Masago is the roe of capelin—this is also usually orange-colored unless it is dyed.

                            After some research I am now able to provide information as to the guidelines and
                            regulations that are followed<br>
                            in the seafood industry in terms of serving raw seafood. As for micro standards for sushi or
                            sashimi grade <br>
                            seafood, I have spoken with many in the seafood industry who supply ‘sushi grade’ fish for
                            sushi and sashimi<br>
                            served at restaurants and they all give me the same answer… they do not know of any
                            regulations from either<br>
                            the FDA or any other agencies regarding ‘sushi grade’ seafood, which is why suppliers have
                            set up their own<br>
                            micro and chemical parameters for their products. A personal search of FDA documents turns
                            up the same <br>
                            results, no clear standards as to what makes fish ‘sushi grade’ or ‘sashimi grade’ and no
                            definition of <br>
                            the term.<br><br>
                            The only concern any inspectors have is referred to as the parasite destruction guarantee,
                            which is <br>
                            accomplished by ‘freezing and storing seafood at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total
                            time), or freezing<br>
                            at -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or
                            freezing at <br>
                            -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours’ which
                            is sufficient <br>
                            to kill parasites. The FDA’s Food Code recommends these freezing conditions to retailers who
                            provide fish <br>
                            intended for raw consumption (for further information, please visit the FDA website). Some
                            exceptions to <br>
                            that rule are bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna, and farmed salmon. I know that is a mouthful,
                            but it’s the facts.<br>
                            Other than a few specific organisms of concern for some seafood, sashimi standards are set
                            as any other <br>
                            ready-to-eat item, e.g. sushi. This means that, aside from the FDA recommendations and local
                            Health <br>
                            Department requirements, there are no laws or recommendations for “sushi/sashimi grade”
                            fish. It is no more<br>
                            than a marketing term.

                        <p>The Beginnings of Sushi<br><br>
                            Sushi has been around for a surprisingly long period of time, although not in its present
                            form. The history of<br>
                            sushi is an interesting tale of the evolution of a simple dish. What was to become sushi was
                            first mentioned <br>
                            in China in the second century A.D. Originally, sushi arose out of a way of preserving food.
                            Fish was placed <br>
                            in rice and allowed to ferment, which allowed an individual to keep the fish edible for some
                            time. The rice <br>
                            was thrown away and the fish was eaten when needed or wanted.<br>
                            The method spread throughout China and by the seventh century, had made its way to Japan,
                            where seafood has <br>
                            historically been a staple. The Japanese, however, took the concept further and began to eat
                            the rice with the<br>
                            fish. Originally, the dish was prepared in much the same manner. In the early 17th century,
                            however, Matsumoto<br>
                            Yoshiichi of Edo (now Tokyo) starting seasoning the rice with rice wine vinegar while making
                            his ‘sushi’ for <br>
                            sale. This allowed the dish to be eaten immediately, instead of waiting the months it might
                            normally take to <br>
                            prepare the ‘sushi.’<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p>The Evolution of Sushi<br><br>
                            In the early 19th century, a man by the name of Hanaya Yohei conceived a major change in the
                            production and<br>
                            presentation of his sushi. No longer wrapping the fish in rice, he placed a piece of fresh
                            fish on top of an <br>
                            oblong shaped piece of seasoned rice. Today, we call this style ‘nigiri sushi’ (finger
                            sushi) or “edomae sushi”<br>
                            (from Edo, the name of Tokyo at the time) and is now the common way of eating Japanese
                            sushi. At that time, <br>
                            sushi was served from sushi stalls on the street and was meant to be a snack or quick bite
                            to eat on the go.<br>
                            Served from his stall, this was not only the first of the real ‘fast food’ sushi, but
                            quickly became wildly <br>
                            popular. From his home in Edo, this style of serving sushi rapidly spread throughout Japan,
                            aided by the Great<br>
                            Kanto earthquake in 1923, as many people lost their homes and businesses and moved from
                            Tokyo.<br><br><br>


                            After World War Two, the sushi stalls were shut down and moved indoors, to more sanitary
                            conditions. More<br>
                            formal seating was later provided (the first iterations were merely an indoor version of the
                            sushi stalls)<br>
                            and sushi changed from ‘fast food’ to a true dining experience. Sushi spread around the
                            globe, and with <br>
                            the advent of the promotion of seafood, this unusual style of serving fish was quickly
                            adopted by western<br>
                            cultures, always eager for something new, especially something that had grown as
                            sophisticated and unique <br>
                            as sushi.

                            Modern Sushi<br><br>
                            Sushi, the artful dining experience once uniquely Japanese, has now evolved to another level
                            beyond the traditional <br>
                            Japanese methods. Western influences have given rise to new styles of sushi, such as
                            California rolls and the many <br>
                            elaborate ‘fusion’ creations at upscale sushi restaurants. The history of sushi is a long
                            one, at least 1,800 years <br>
                            in fact, but the current iteration is popular around the world, and rightly so. It is not
                            often that something so singly<br>
                            cultural can not only take the world by storm, but also influence the direction of food in
                            other cultures. Demand for <br>
                            sushi is only increasing and seems to be continuing to evolve. Traditional sushi restaurants
                            sit alongside ‘fusion’ <br>
                            restaurants and both are popular for their own reasons. The history of sushi is still far
                            from over.
