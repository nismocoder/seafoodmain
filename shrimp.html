                            <p>Primarily obtained from the west coast of Florida, these shrimps are really popular in
                                seafood cuisine.<br>
                                As the name suggests, these shrimps are generally pink when raw although some can be
                                white
                                and gray <br>
                                as well. These shrimps are relatively smaller in size and are also called ‘salad

                                because they<br>
                                are widely used for serving mild and sweet flavors in shrimp salads.

                            or even frying. They come in three main varieties, namely Chinese White, Gulf White, and

                            They are a good preference for many chefs due to their classic flavor, firm texture, sweet

                            until a special machine was designed in the late 1960s to peel off their rock-hard shells

                            They have a firm texture and sweet flavor similar to the spiny lobster. This flavor makes

                        <p>Originating from Southern China, this exclusive species got its name due to the yellow or
                            white body with black stripes <br>
                            that somewhat make them look like a bumblebee. Bumblebee shrimps come from the Caridina
                            breviate family, and although <br>
                            the name might suggest otherwise, this variety is not related to the popular Bee Shrimp
                            which belongs to the Caridina <br>
                            cantonensis family.<br><br>

                            This type of shrimps loves to be fed meaty varieties of shrimp food, such as small pieces of
                            fish, regularly. To help <br>
                            them flourish, keep them in pairs with a strict check on the nitrites, iodine, and copper
                            concentrations in the water.<br>
                            Before adding them to the aquarium, take care that there are no large aggressive fishes as
                            Bumblebee shrimps can be <br>
                            easily eaten up by predators due to their tiny sizes.

                        <p>This red variety of Neocaridina davidi species might not seem so different at first, but it
                            is still a popular choice <br>
                            amongst many aquarists due to its bright and showy color. These shrimps flourish in
                            freshwater that is at room temperature<br>
                            or mildly cool (18 to 28 degrees Celsius). Higher temperatures promote breeding but can be
                            dangerous at times because <br>
                            the oxygen concentration is reduced in warm water.<br><br>

                            Red Cherry shrimps are peaceful creatures and do well in community tanks. They are
                            omnivorous in nature and love to feed <br>
                            on algae as well as on any other fish food leftover by other species in the tank. You can
                            also feed them pellets as a <br>
                            supplemental diet or if you have a tank that only houses the Red Cherry shrimps.

                        <p>Tiger shrimp or to be more precise, Blue Tiger shrimp is the blue variant of the Caridina
                            cantonensis shrimp family that<br>
                            measure about 1- 1.5 inches long when mature. These shrimps are characterized by the
                            distinct blue stripes on their body<br>
                            that are highlighted all the more by their vivid orange eyes.<br><br>

                            Blue Tiger shrimps flourish in freshwater tanks that are maintained at a neutral pH level
                            but can do equally well in slightly<br>
                            acidic conditions as well (about 6 pH). This variety looks remarkable against the green
                            decorations that are typical of most<br>
                            fish tanks but note that while they are not really very difficult to keep, maintaining Blue
                            Tiger shrimps is not as easy as <br>
                            keeping Red Cherry shrimps either.<br><br>

                            Blue Tiger shrimps require proper tank cleaning every week (or every alternative week),
                            well-maintained pH level as well as a<br>
                            proper diet. There are omnivorous in nature so you can feed them with both, plant and
                            meat-based fish food but remember that<br>
                            overfeeding supplemental foods tends to raise the nitrite and ammonia levels in water and
                            can prove hazardous to these shrimps.

                            As is evident by its name, this type of shrimp features a bright blue head that gradually

                            aquarium because they are easily spotted<br>
                            as unique, intense blue beauties against the green plants and other colorful pebbles in the
                            water tank.<br><br>

                            Being related to the Blue Tiger shrimps, the Blue Bolt shrimps have similar care
                            requirements which include frequent water cleaning<br>
                            and careful feeding.

                        <p>The pure white eggs of these shrimps look like snowballs! If you are new to the world of
                            setting up an aquarium, snowball shrimps are a<br>
                            great choice as they can be cared for in large numbers and in different water conditions
                            such as hard and soft water. However, overfeeding<br>
                            them will disturb water quality and can lead to shrimp health issues.<br><br>

                            Clean water with a pH of 6.5 to 8.0 is significant for their healthy survival. Although they
                            are omnivorous in nature, most of them love<br>
                            to eat algae and hence, are a good collection to control the algae in aquariums. Snowball
                            Shrimps breed quickly, and if kept safe from <br>
                            predators, will be seen actively swimming around and bringing life to the aquarium.

                        <div class="shrimpPic12"></div>
                        <p>Sharing ancestry with the original Bee shrimp (Caridina cantonensis), this type of shrimp was
                            selectively bred for ornamental use. Crystal <br>
                            shrimps are available in two varieties: the Crystal Red and the Crystal Black
                            shrimp.<br><br>

                            They both have the same maintenance needs and are similar in nature except the fact their
                            bumble bee-like pattern is of different colors. <br>
                            The Crystal Red shrimp features a combination of vibrant red and white stripes while the
                            other species is its monochromatic equivalent.<br><br>

                            Caring for this type of shrimps in a home aquarium is relatively difficult as great purity
                            of water is needed for them to thrive. You will <br>
                            also have to decorate the water tank in such a manner that sufficient hiding places are
                            created for Crystal shrimps. This is because they <br>
                            don’t really like to swim much freely in exposed and visible waters.<br><br>

                            Also, if you wish to house them in a community tank, then don’t forget that the other tank
                            inhabitants must be peaceful in nature otherwise<br>
                            you must keep the Crystal shrimps separately because they easily fall prey to the aggressive
                            tank mates.

                        <p>Ghost Shrimp, also known as Glass Shrimp are a fascinating species of the Palaemonetes
                            family. Nothing describes them better than their own name<br>
                            because given their mostly clear, transparent body they truly do look like a shaped glass.
                            These see-through shrimps are easily protected from <br>
                            predators and can be kept alone or in a group.<br><br>

                            Housing a considerable number of Glass Shrimps is usually a smart choice for community tanks
                            because these tiny creatures do an excellent job of <br>
                            keeping the tank relatively clean. Not only will the Ghost Shrimp eat the leftover bits of
                            fish food but also lick off any algae patches.<br><br>

                            This type of shrimps is easy to look after and will stay happy even in small tanks that have
                            a capacity of only 5 gallons. Ghost shrimps have a <br>
                            lifespan of about one year and measure almost an inch and a half when matured.<br><br>

                            Like most other varieties, these are not very selective about their diet because they are
                            omnivorous and can do with meaty and plant-based foods <br>
                            alike. Ghost shrimps love to hide in nooks and crannies. So, make sure that you have
                            appropriate decorations in your tank.

                        <p>If you love to have multicolor species in your shrimp tank, then the Caridina Babaulti
                            shrimps are your best bet. This is because they are a colorful <br>
                            species that can be found in red, brown, green, and yellow shades as well in a
                            monochromatic, zebra-style pattern. Quite easy to care for, the Babaulti<br>
                            shrimps are omnivorous but are more inclined towards feeding upon decaying plant matter in
                            the aquariums rather than being given meaty food.<br><br>

                            Despite the low-maintenance needs, the basic factors for their healthy flourishing are still
                            a must, for instance, good filtration, balanced pH levels,<br>
                            stable temperatures, and controlled levels of ammonia and nitrites.

                            therefore not a very good choice for novice aquarists. Belonging to the Caridina cantonensis
                            family, these ‘Panda’ shrimps are sensitive to water changes,<br>
                            so it is best to house them in larger tanks where the fluctuations in water conditions are
                            easier to control.<br><br>

                            Panda shrimps are herbivores but require careful nourishment because overfeeding can be
                            extremely hazardous to their health or at times, even fatal.
