                    <div class="octoType3">

                        <h1>3. Blue Ringed Octopus</h1>
                        <div class="octoPic3"></div>
                        <p>Because of the small blue rings that look like they’re painted around their bodies, the
                            blue-ringed octopus are not<br>
                            difficult to spot. Like other octopus, they can camouflage themselves and turn any color
                            they need to be for protection,<br>
                            but these blue rings always remain.<br><br>

                            Most of the colors that they turn are similar to the colors found in coral reefs, which
                            means that no one can ever tell <br>
                            there is an octopus in the vicinity. More often than not, these octopus are yellow,
                            cream, or brown in color, allowing them<br>
                            to blend in very well with everything else found under the ocean.<br><br>

                            However, the blue rings make them distinct from other types of octopus and very
                            noticeable, as well. Indeed, the blue-ringed <br>
                            octopus has a very eye-catching body, and they are very impressive to look at.<br><br>

                            They are small but powerful creatures, and they are flexible due to the fact that they
                            have no skeleton. Their size usually <br>
                            reaches only eight inches in length, even though their arms have a very wide arm spread,
                            something which is needed to catch <br>
                            their prey.<br><br>

                            Moreover, they often swim in the water instead of crawling like other types of octopus,
                            and even though their size is tiny, <br>
                            they can spew out large amounts of venom to paralyze their prey, quite a feat for an
                            animal with such a small body.<br><br>

                            Evolution-wise, no one really knows how the blue-ringed octopus came about because they
                            have bodies that are quite different<br>
                            than all other creatures found in the water. They are also very aggressive, staying to
                            fight their prey instead of running away.<br><br>

                            In fact, they even fight with other octopus if they are trying to keep food or shelter
                            for themselves. If you ever find yourself<br>
                            in the midst of a blue-ringed octopus, it is best to be careful because their venom is
                            very strong and can cause human beings a <br>
                            lot of physical damage.

                <div class="content2">
                    <div class="octoType4">

                        <h1>4. California Two-Spot Octopus</h1>
                        <div class="octoPic4"></div>
                        <p>With a very distinct appearance, the California Two-Spot octopus is also called the
                            Bimac
                            octopus. Blue spots of various shades are<br>
                            found around their eyes, and their bodies get to roughly seven inches long, although
                            they have arms that can reach up to 25 feet wide.<br><br>

                            Since their body color matches their environment, their overall body color can vary
                            widely. Most of the time, this type of octopus is a grayish<br>
                            color with yellow spots. Because they can camouflage themselves for protection, they
                            can
                            be found in many other colors as well.<br><br>

                            The California Two-Spot octopus does best in waters that stay between 65 and 72
                            degrees
                            Fahrenheit. This is one of the reasons they are so common<br>
                            in areas such as Africa, Mexico, and certain areas of Japan. They love to hide in
                            various crevices, holes, and even rocks, and they are even <br>
                            considered one of the friendliest species of octopus.<br><br>

                            They are also very intelligent, being able to take the lid off of an aquarium and
                            escape. As a general rule, this type of octopus trust their <br>
                            ability to blend in, which means they don’t always go into hiding as much as other
                            types
                            of octopus do.<br><br>

                            Unlike other types of Octopus, the California Two-Spot is a not dangerous animal,
                            and,
                            therefore, humans have been known to interact with them. <br>
                            Of course, they are very fast swimmers so if you want to get near them, you have to
                            act
                            quickly. In addition, this type of octopus sometimes <br>
                            releases ink when trying to get away, enabling them to get away without being
                            noticed.<br><br>

                        <h1>5. Caribbean Reef Octopus</h1>
                        <div class="octoPic5"></div>
                        <p>With a beautiful blue-green color, the Caribbean Reef octopus is stunning to look
                            at.
                            Since they can camouflage themselves, they can<br>
                            also have various shades of brown throughout their bodies. They are very similar
                            to the
                            Common octopus, and if you’re curious how <br>
                            to tell the two animals apart, simply look at their eyes.<br><br>

                            The Caribbean Reef octopus has eyes with circles of dark colors around them. The
                            body of
                            this octopus is roughly five inches long, <br>
                            but it has an arm span of about 23 inches. In fact, due to their environment,
                            the
                            Caribbean Reef octopus’ size varies quite a bit, <br>
                            which means its overall size is difficult to speculate.<br><br>

                            This type of octopus is considered a medium-sized animal, with a weight of
                            roughly three
                            pounds. They have a very large head, arms <br>
                            that are very thick, and they move much more slowly than other types of octopus.
                            Because
                            they can lie flat to blend in with their <br>
                            surroundings, they often look like a small parachute laying on the
                            ground.<br><br>

                            They are found in areas such as the Atlantic Ocean, the Bahamas, and of course,
                            the
                            Caribbean area. They eat mostly crustaceans, <br>
                            and they spend most of their nights looking for food. They also do not live very
                            long,
                            and if you look at them under any type of <br>
                            lighting, you’ll notice that they actually glow in the dark.

                        <p>The Common octopus varies greatly in size. They can range from 12 to 36
                            inches in length
                            and can weigh anywhere between seven and 20<br>
                            pounds. Because of this variety, the Common octopus is often confused with
                            other types
                            of octopus. If you look at their eyes, they<br>
                            can seem too big for the octopus’ body, and their heads are quite large as
                            well.<br><br>

                            They also come in such a wide selection of colors that they can blend in
                            anywhere they
                            live, meaning they can be almost any color <br>
                            when you find them. They live in both temperate and tropical waters, and
                            they have been
                            found in every ocean on the planet.<br><br>

                            Common octopus has been studied more than any other type of octopus, and
                            they have been
                            proven to be extremely intelligent. The <br>
                            tasks they are able to perform include getting food out of lobster traps,
                            distinguishing
                            between various shapes, determining the <br>
                            sizes of various objects, and they can even tell how bright something
                            is.<br><br>

                            They are also extremely good at hiding, even creating little shelters
                            underwater that
                            they often form a fortress around. They eat <br>
                            mostly crustaceans, including crayfish, crabs, and mollusks, and they are
                            only in
                            existence for one to two years.

                        <h1>7. East Pacific Red Octopus</h1>
                        <div class="octoPic7"></div>
                        <p>The East Pacific Red octopus is very small in size and weighs only five
                            ounces. Their
                            body is three times smaller than the length<br>
                            of their arms, and as adults, their overall length can get up to
                            approximately 20
                            inches.<br><br>

                            In addition, there is no way to tell the difference between the males
                            and females of the
                            species just by looking at them, and they<br>
                            turn so many colors that it is possible for you to be staring at this
                            type of octopus
                            and not even realize that’s what it is. They<br>
                            change into a variety of colors, even though their primary color is red,
                            and these can
                            include brownish-red, white, yellow, and brown.<br><br>

                            Found frequently along the West Coast reaching up to Alaska, the East
                            Pacific Red
                            octopus usually go no more than 300 feet under the<br>
                            water, although they have been known to go deeper if they are in need of
                            food. They are
                            less picky than other octopus when it comes<br>
                            to food, eating mostly clams, crabs, scallops, and some types of
                            fish.<br><br>

                            They also have rather odd eating habits, as they take hold of their food
                            and go back to
                            their “home” to consume it. If they want more<br>
                            food afterward, they simply go back out in the water and search again.
                            In fact, they
                            often stack the shells of their food outside of<br>
                            their living environment, which is sometimes the only way to tell that
                            there is an
                            octopus nearby.

                    <div class="octoType8">

                        <h1>8. Mimic Octopus</h1>
                        <div class="octoPic8"></div>
                        <p>With an overall size of about two feet when fully grown, the Mimic
                            octopus gets its name
                            from the fact that they can copy the behaviors<br>
                            of the animals around them. They do this to make their capture a lot
                            more difficult.
                            They are usually brown and white in color, <br>
                            enabling them to blend in regardless of their surroundings, and they
                            consist of both
                            stripes and spots to blend in even better.<br><br>

                            These octopuses are found in the South East Asia area, and they were
                            only discovered in
                            the late 1990s. Some experts believe this<br>
                            type of octopus might be found in other habitats, but no one knows
                            for sure as of yet.
                            They prefer muddy and warm waters, and they<br>
                            seem not to like other animals very much.<br><br>

                            The animals that they mimic include eel, starfish, jellyfish, and
                            stingrays. They both
                            copy these animals’ movements and turn their<br>
                            bodies to the colors of those animals, enabling every inch of them
                            to look like the
                            original animal.<br><br>

                            The Mimic octopus is very intelligent, and they are one of only a
                            few octopuses that
                            makes burrows and tunnels on the ocean floor. <br>
                            They use these tunnels and burrows to hide from predators and also
                            to follow them
                            discreetly until the time comes to attack them.<br><br>

                            Because they mimic other animals and are therefore protected from
                            those animals’ prey,
                            this means that they have access to a lot of<br>
                            different food sources. They eat everything from crabs and fish to
                            worms and other
                            crustaceans, and they have also been known to <br>
                            participate in cannibalism.<br><br>

                            Because they are found mostly around the bay area of Malaysia, the
                            Mimic octopus have
                            access to a lot of different food sources, <br>
                            making their diet quite varied.

                        <h1>9. North Pacific Giant Octopus</h1>
                        <div class="octoPic9"></div>
                        <p>This octopus is the largest species in the octopus world. It can
                            get as long as 15 feet
                            in length and nearly 150 pounds, and its<br>
                            overall size depends on its environment and several other
                            factors. Of course, these
                            sizes are numbers that have been officially<br>
                            recorded, but some experts think that it is very possible to
                            find other North Pacific
                            Giant octopus that is a lot bigger.<br><br>

                            When it comes to its camouflage ability, it is able to change
                            its pigmentation a lot
                            easier than other octopus species, mainly<br>
                            because it is unable to move as quickly as other octopus or fit
                            into small areas and
                            therefore, they use camouflage to blend <br>
                            in so that their predators do not detect where they are.<br><br>

                            The North Pacific Giant octopus can be light or dark, brown, or
                            red, but they can be any
                            color because their habitat directly <br>
                            affects what color they are. Due to their ability to flatten
                            out, they often look like a
                            tan starfish when lying on the ocean <br>
                            floor, and they have long, thick arms and very large
                            heads.<br><br>

                            Their arms contain suction-type devices, and the center of their
                            body is spherical in
                            shape, which enables them to move a lot <br>
                            more easily and quickly through the water.<br><br>

                            When it comes to their personalities, very little is known about
                            the North Pacific Giant
                            octopus. They do seem to have the ability<br>
                            to learn things at all times, and they also become spooked very
                            easily.<br><br>

                            Since they often are unable to move as quickly as other octopus,
                            they tend to use their
                            ink a lot more to get away from predators,<br>
                            and the ink they do produce tends to be darker and more
                            noticeable in color. They are
                            mostly found roughly 200 feet under the<br>
                            North Pacific Ocean, but they will move in even deeper if they
                            need food or shelter.
